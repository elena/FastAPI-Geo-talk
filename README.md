pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn

uvicorn app:app --reload
```

This is the whole thing, a self contained little repo <3

Grateful to all the people who have put in the time that lets me even use these tools and talk about this stuff.

On repo housekeeping: keeping as tidy as possible but not making a huge effort to keep repo clean, leaving a bunch of mistakes and workings in as there's not tremendous value in spending time cleaning it up once the talk is cooked.
